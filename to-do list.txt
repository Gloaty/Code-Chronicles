Build a carousel where the quotes cycle through it when the page is reloaded, like what I did before with the PetShop project.
However, for that to work, I'll need to wrangle JavaScript to my favor, but I have an idea. If i create an array of variables, each variable containing a quote, 
and I'll use a bit of pseudorandomness to power it. Or, i could just iterate through the array every time a function is called, AKA the website is reloaded.

I will start to use this text file as a sort of to do list, so this file can expect much more work coming from me.
