Build a carousel where the quotes cycle through it when the page is reloaded, like what I did before with the PetShop project.
However, for that to work, I'll need to wrangle JavaScript to my favor, but I have an idea. If i create an array of variables, each variable containing a quote, 
and I'll use a bit of pseudorandomness to power it. Or, i could just iterate through the array every time a function is called, AKA the website is reloaded.

On all pages except for the homepage, I'll need to align the logo to the left side of the page. I'll do this by adding in a header in the CSS file.
I've created a new CSS file just for the homepage, nd I'll do that soon. Here's a link to help me ut with this.

Me meddling with the images and CSS + HTML has created multiple bugs. The logo and favicon are in a shaky spot at the moment, so I'll need to work on them. 
A few other bugs, such as the formatting of the webpage, are still present. I'll work on them soon. I'll commit the changes to the repository soon.

I will start to use this text file as a sort of to do list, so this file can expect much more work coming from me.
